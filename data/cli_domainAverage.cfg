#
#	This is an example command line interface (cli) configuration file.
#	
#	This particular file illustrates the necessary options settings to
#	do a simple domain average initialization run without diurnal
#	winds.  The mesh resolution is chosen as 'coarse'.  The output file
#	resolution is defaulted to the mesh resolution (no value specifed),
#	except for the ASCII output files which are set to 200 meters.
